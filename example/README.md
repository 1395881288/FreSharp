##### Windows Installation - Important!

* Copy the contents of the "c_sharp_libs" folder into the bin folder of your AIRSDK. 
The location of this will vary depending on your IDE or. These dlls need to reside in the folder where adl.exe is run from.
* For release builds, these files need to be packaged in the same folder as your exe
* This ANE was built with MS Visual Studio 2015. As such your machine (and user's machines) will need to have Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x86) runtime installed. Windows 10 machines will have this but perhaps not Windows 7.
